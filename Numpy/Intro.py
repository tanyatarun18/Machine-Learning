# Numpy is a fundamental package for mathematical computing in python
# It is a library based on C for performance. In ml and datascience, we work with large dataset which requires good performance.
# Numpy is a n-dimensional array(np array) of homogenous datatype.

# Difference B/W List and Numpy
# 1. List is dynamic but numpy has fixed size.
# 2. Changing size of array will delete the original array and create new array.
# 3. In np array all elements are required to be of same data type.
